This project is a proof of concept about [DEAP](http://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/overview.html) in Python
developed by Fernando Jiménez and Sergio Rodríguez.

# Goals

* Learn [DEAP](http://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/overview.html) library.
* Learn Artificial Intelligence techniques.
* Learn genetic algorithm.
* And the most important, *have fun*.

# The problem

A company needs to solve the [Travelling salesman problem or TSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).
It needs to know the shortest route to deliver orders daily. This problem is NP-hard, so the company wants us to solve this problem
using some artificial intelligence technique.

Its headquarter is located in [Seville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville), and they deliver orders
for [Andalusia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia). Simplify, is able to go from any point to any other point using
the Euclidean distance.

Note, that this problem is focused as [local search or optimization problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_search_(optimization)).
